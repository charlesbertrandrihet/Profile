	     <h2> âš½ Football âš½   </h2>

	     <p>  Since my early years i kicked in a ball for fun, firstly doing it in my kitchen with my dad, then at school with my friends and finally entering in a semi-professional club when i was about 13. It helps me express a passion through a physical activity and to make new friends thanks to it.

	     <h2> ðŸŽ‡Culture LearningðŸŽ‡  </h2>

	     <p>  During my hole life i was exposed to different cultures due to my motherâ€™s job, and it helped me to grow a lot as an individual and to have a better understanding of myself and my surroundings. Having lived in 4 different countries i hope that next year iâ€™ll have the opportunity to reach out other regions that still remains unknown to me.
